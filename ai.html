        <h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.<br>
            The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.<br>
            It is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.<br> 
            The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, <br>
            such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, <br>
            it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency.

        <h2><u>Types Of AI</u></h2>
        <p>
            When someone asks you to explain the different types of Artificial Intelligence systems, you must categorize them based on their functionalities.<br>
            Based on the functionality of AI-based systems, AI can be categorized into the following types:<br>

1. Reactive Machines AI<br>
2. Limited Memory AI<br>
3. Theory Of Mind AI<br>
4. Self-aware AI
