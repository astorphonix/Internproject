            <h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
            <br>*Analog image processing is any image processing task conducted on two-dimensional analog signals by analog means (as opposed to digital image processing)./<br>
            <br>*Basically any data can be represented in two types named as</br>
            <br> *1.Analog 2.Digital if the pictorial representation of the data represented in analog wave formats that can be named as analog image.</br>
              E.g.: television broadcasting in older days.. through the dish antenna systems.. </br>
             <br> *Where as the digital representation or storing the data in digital form is termed as a digital image processing<br>
               E.g.:image data stored in digital logic gates..
               <h2><u>What is Analog Image Processing?</u></h2>
               <p>
                1. The analog image processing is applied on analog signals and it processes only two-dimensional signals.<br>
                2. Analog signal is time-varying signals so the images formed under analog image processing get varied.<br>
                3. Analog image processing is a slower and costlier process.<br>
                4. Analog signal is a real-world but not good quality of images.<br>
                5. It is generally continuous and not broken into tiny components.<br>
