        <h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
        <p>
            Computer graphics is a sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content.<br>
             Although the term often refers to the study of three-dimensional computer graphics,<br> 
             it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and image processing.
        </p>
        <h2><u>Why computer graphics used?</u></h2>
        <p>
            Suppose a shoe manufacturing company want to show the sale of shoes for five years.<br>
             For this vast amount of information is to store. So a lot of time and memory will be needed.<br> 
             This method will be tough to understand by a common man. In this situation graphics is a better alternative.<br> 
             Graphics tools are charts and graphs.<br>
              Using graphs, data can be represented in pictorial form.<br>
             A picture can be understood easily just with a single look.<br>
             Interactive computer graphics work using the concept of two-way communication between computer users. <br>
             The computer will receive signals from the input device, and the picture is modified accordingly. Picture will be changed quickly when we apply command.
