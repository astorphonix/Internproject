            <h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
         <br> * Digital image processing deals with manipulation of digital images through a digital computer.</br> 
         <br>  * It is a subfield of signals and systems but focus particularly on images. </br>
         <br>  * DIP focuses on developing a computer system that is able to perform processing on an image.</br> 
         <br> * The input of that system is a digital image and the system process that image using efficient algorithms,
            and gives an image as an output. The most common example is Adobe Photoshop. </br>
            <br> * It is one of the widely used application for processing digital images.

       <h2> <u>Major techniques of digital image processing are as follows:</u></h2>
    <h3>1.Image Editing</h3> , which basically means altering digital images by means of graphic software tools.<br>
<h3>2.Image Restoration,</h3> which refers to the estimation of a clean original image out of the corrupt image taken in order to get back the information lost.<br>
<h3>3.Independent Component Analysis,</h3> which separates a multivariate signal computationally into additive subcomponents.<br>
<h3>4. Anisotropic Diffusion,</h3> which is often known as Perona-Malik Diffusion, makes it possible to reduce image noise without having to remove important parts of the image.<br>
<h3>5.Linear Filtering.</h3> It’s another digital image processing technique, which refers to processing time-varying input signals and producing output signals that are subject to the constraint of linearity.<br>
<h3>6. Neural Networks, </h3>which are computational models widely used in machine learning for solving various tasks.<br>
<h3>7.Pixelation,</h3> which often refers to turning printed images into digitized ones (such as GIF).<br>
<h3>8.Principal Components Analysis,</h3> a digital image processing technique that can be used for feature extraction.<br>
<h3>9.Partial Differential Equations,</h3> which also is dealing with effectively de-noising images.<br>
<h3>10.Hidden Markov Models,</h3> a technique used for image analysis in two dimensions.<br>
<h3>11.Wavelets,</h3> which stands for a mathematical function that’s used in image compression.<br>
<h3>12.Self-organizing Maps,</h3> a digital image processing technique for classifying images into a number of classes.
