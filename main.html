<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Signal processing is a discipline in electrical engineering and in mathematics that deals with analysis and processing of analog and digital signals , and deals with storing , filtering , and other operations on signals. These signals include transmission signals , sound or voice signals , image signals , and other signals e.t.c.

        Out of all these signals , the field that deals with the type of signals for which the input is an image and the output is also an image is done in image processing. As it name suggests, it deals with the processing on images.
        
        It can be further divided into analog image processing and digital image processing.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        

        <h2><u>Types of Image Processing:</u></h2>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><u>What is an Image?</u></h2>
<p>
    An image is nothing more than a two dimensional signal. It is defined by the mathematical function f(x,y) where x and y are the two co-ordinates horizontally and vertically.

The value of f(x,y) at any point is gives the pixel value at that point of an image.

<p>The above figure is an example of digital image that you are now viewing on your computer screen.<br>
But actually , this image is nothing but a two dimensional array of numbers ranging between 0 and 255.</p>
<br>
    
<table>
   <tr>
      <td>128</td>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>123</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>232</td>
        <td>123</td>
        <td>321</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>123</td>
        <td>77</td>
        <td>89</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>80</td>
        <td>255</td>
        <td>255</td>
      </tr>  
  </table>
  <br>
        
  <p>Each number represents the value of the function f(x,y) at any point.<br>
   In this case the value 128 , 230 ,123 each represents an individual pixel value. <br>
   The dimensions of the picture is actually the dimensions of this two dimensional array.</p>

        <h2><u>Signal</u></h2>
        <h4>In physical world, any quantity measurable through time over space or any higher dimension can be taken as a signal. A signal is a mathematical function, and it conveys some information.<br>
            A signal can be one dimensional or two dimensional or higher dimensional signal. One dimensional signal is a signal that is measured over time. The common example is a voice signal.<br>
            The two dimensional signals are those that are measured over some other physical quantities. The example of two dimensional signal is a digital image. We will look in more detail in the next tutorial<br> 
            of how a one dimensional or two dimensional signals and higher signals are formed and interpreted.<br>
            Data is superimposed on a carrier current or wave by means of a process called modulation.

        <h2><u>Digital Image</u></h2>
        <h4>Since capturing an image from a camera is a physical process.<br>
             The sunlight is used as a source of energy. A sensor array is used for the acquisition of the image. <br>
             So when the sunlight falls upon the object, then the amount of light reflected by that object is sensed by the sensors,<br>
              and a continuous voltage signal is generated by the amount of sensed data.<br>
               In order to create a digital image , we need to convert this data into a digital form. <br>
               This involves sampling and quantization. (They are discussed later on).<br>
                The result of sampling and quantization results in an two dimensional array or matrix of numbers which are nothing but a digital image.
                A digital image is formed by the small bits of data i.e. pixels, which are stored in computers.<br>
                 When we capture an image in our digital camera in presence of light it saves.</h4>
