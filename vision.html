        <h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
        <p>
            Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do

        <h2><u>Applications:</u></h2>
        <p>
            Many of the applications you use every day employ computer-vision technology. Google uses it to help you search for objects and scenes—say, "dog" or "sunset"—in your Images library.

Other companies use computer vision to help enhance images. One example is Adobe Lightroom CC, which uses machine-learning algorithms to enhance the details of zoomed images. Traditional zooming uses interpolation techniques to color the zoomed-in areas, but Lightroom uses computer vision to detect objects in images and sharpen their features when zooming in.

One field that has seen remarkable progress thanks to advances in computer vision is facial recognition. Apple uses facial-recognition algorithms to unlock iPhones. Facebook uses facial recognition to detect users in pictures you post online (though not everyone is a fan). In China, many retailers now provide facial-recognition payment technology, relieving their customers of the need to reach into their pockets.

Advances in facial recognition have also caused worry among privacy and rights advocates, though, especially as government agencies in different countries are using it for surveillance.

Content moderation is another important application for computer vision. Companies such as Facebook must review billions of posts every day and remove images and videos that contain violence, extremism, or pornography. Most social-media networks use deep-learning algorithms to analyze posts and flag those that contain banned content.
